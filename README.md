# Government Scheme Recommendation System

## Overview

The Government Scheme Recommendation System is a web-based application that provides personalized recommendations for government schemes based on users' demographic details such as gender, age, state, and more. The system helps users discover schemes they are eligible for and allows administrators to add new schemes to the system.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** 
  - Secure login and signup pages using Streamlit.
  - Users can manage their profiles, updating personal details such as gender, state, income, etc.

- **Scheme Recommendation:** 
  - Recommends government schemes based on user information.
  - Tailors recommendations according to gender, state, age, and other personal details.

- **Admin Portal:** 
  - Admins can add new schemes with specific eligibility criteria.
  - Admins can manage user data and interact with the user profiles.
  - SMS notifications are sent to users when new schemes relevant to their profiles are added.

- **Profile Management:** 
  - Users can update their profile details.
  - Admins can view user profiles and interactions through the admin dashboard.

- **SMS Notifications:** 
  - Integrated Twilio API to send SMS notifications to users about new schemes they may qualify for.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend & Framework:** Python, Streamlit
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, CSV
- **Notifications:** Twilio API (for SMS)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Hosting:** Streamlit Cloud (or specify your hosting service)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A Twilio account for SMS notifications (create an account at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)).
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit pandas twilio
  ```

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/government-scheme-recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd government-scheme-recommendation-system
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run login.py
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Add your Twilio credentials in the `login.py` file:
     ```python
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid'
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'
     TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

## Admin Portal

- The admin portal allows administrators to add new schemes, view user profiles, and send notifications to users.
- Access the admin portal from the main dashboard after logging in as an admin.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding email notifications as an alternative to SMS.
